- [ ] List scrolling is smooth
- [ ] Empty state handles correctly
- [ ] Large text content displays properly

### 2.2 Study System
- [ ] Start study session from Home tab
- [ ] Question → Answer → Grade flow works
- [ ] Correct/Incorrect button responses
- [ ] Progress indicator updates
- [ ] Study completion state
- [ ] Next due dates calculate correctly
- [ ] Study streak counting works

### 2.3 Settings & Configuration
- [ ] Notification time picker works
- [ ] Time changes apply immediately
- [ ] Interval table displays (read-only)
- [ ] Settings persist across app launches

## Phase 3: Notification System Testing

### 3.1 Permission Handling
- [ ] Initial permission request appears
- [ ] DENY permission: App doesn't crash
- [ ] DENY permission: Appropriate error message shown
- [ ] ALLOW permission: Success confirmation
- [ ] Permission status checked correctly
- [ ] Permission re-request after denial

### 3.2 Notification Delivery
- [ ] Set notification 1 minute in future
- [ ] Close app completely
- [ ] Notification arrives on time
- [ ] Notification content is correct
- [ ] Tap notification opens app
- [ ] Daily notifications schedule properly

### 3.3 Background Behavior
- [ ] App backgrounded during study: state preserved
- [ ] App terminated during study: data saved
- [ ] Notification permissions work after app restart
- [ ] Background app refresh settings respected

## Phase 4: Data Persistence & Reliability

### 4.1 Data Integrity
- [ ] Cards persist after app force-close
- [ ] Study progress saves correctly
- [ ] Settings changes persist
- [ ] Review history maintains accuracy
- [ ] Data survives device restart

### 4.2 Error Recovery
- [ ] Handle corrupted data files gracefully
- [ ] Recover from incomplete study sessions
- [ ] Handle storage permission issues
- [ ] Network interruption doesn't affect offline features
- [ ] Low storage space handled properly

## Phase 5: Performance & Stress Testing

### 5.1 Large Dataset Performance
**Use PerformanceTestingView for automated testing:**
- [ ] Add 100+ cards: completes in <5 seconds
- [ ] Search through 500+ cards: <0.1 seconds
- [ ] List scrolling remains smooth
- [ ] Memory usage stays reasonable
- [ ] Study session with large dataset works

### 5.2 Memory & Resource Management
- [ ] Memory usage stable during extended use
- [ ] No memory leaks detected
- [ ] CPU usage reasonable during operations
- [ ] Battery drain acceptable
- [ ] Storage usage grows predictably

### 5.3 Edge Case Testing
- [ ] Device time change during study session
- [ ] Cross midnight study session (JST boundary)
- [ ] Phone call interruption during study
- [ ] Low battery mode activation
- [ ] Device rotation during all operations

## Phase 6: Accessibility & Usability

### 6.1 Accessibility Features
- [ ] VoiceOver navigation works
- [ ] Dynamic text sizing supported
- [ ] High contrast mode compatible
- [ ] Reduced motion settings respected
- [ ] Accessibility labels present

### 6.2 Device Compatibility
- [ ] Works on iPhone (various sizes)
- [ ] Works on iPad (if supported)
- [ ] Portrait orientation stable
- [ ] Landscape orientation (if supported)
- [ ] Safe area handling correct

## Phase 7: Production Readiness

### 7.1 App Store Preparation
- [ ] App metadata complete
- [ ] Privacy policy requirements met
- [ ] No hardcoded test data
- [ ] Debug features removed/disabled
- [ ] Performance meets App Store guidelines

### 7.2 Final Validation
**Run AppValidationTests.swift:**
- [ ] All unit tests pass
- [ ] All validation tests pass
- [ ] E2E scenario tests pass
- [ ] No critical issues in logs
- [ ] App ready for submission

## Critical Success Criteria ⭐

The following must ALL pass for production readiness:

1. **Zero Crashes**: App must not crash under any normal usage pattern
2. **Data Integrity**: No data loss under any circumstances
3. **Notification Reliability**: Notifications work consistently when permissions granted
4. **Performance Standards**: 
   - App launch: <3 seconds
   - Card search: <0.1 seconds
   - Study operations: <0.5 seconds
5. **Permission Handling**: Graceful handling of denied permissions
6. **Battery Efficiency**: No excessive battery drain
7. **Storage Efficiency**: Reasonable storage usage growth

## Testing Tools Provided

1. **DeviceTestingGuide.swift**: Utility functions for device testing
2. **PerformanceTestingView.swift**: UI for performance testing (DEBUG builds only)
3. **AppValidationTests.swift**: Comprehensive validation test suite
4. **E2EScenarioTests.swift**: End-to-end integration tests
