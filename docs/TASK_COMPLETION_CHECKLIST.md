# Task Completion Checklist

**MANDATORY STEPS** for every completed task:

## Before Implementation
- [ ] Read current task in `.kiro/specs/spaced-repetition-ios-app/tasks.md`
- [ ] Check requirements in `.kiro/specs/spaced-repetition-ios-app/requirements.md`
- [ ] Review design in `.kiro/specs/spaced-repetition-ios-app/design.md`

## During Implementation
- [ ] Write minimal, working code following MVVM + Repository pattern
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests for business logic
- [ ] Run Xcode build to verify compilation

## After Implementation (CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP)
- [ ] **Update tasks.md**: Mark task as [x] completed in `.kiro/specs/spaced-repetition-ios-app/tasks.md`
- [ ] Verify all acceptance criteria are met
- [ ] Git commit with descriptive message
- [ ] Git push to remote repository

## Verification
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Code follows architectural patterns
- [ ] Task is marked complete in tasks.md
- [ ] Changes are committed and pushed

**FAILURE TO UPDATE TASKS.MD IS A CRITICAL ERROR**
